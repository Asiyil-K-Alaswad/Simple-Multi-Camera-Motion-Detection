# YOLOv8 + DeepSORT Implementation Summary

## Overview

The object tracker has been successfully upgraded from simple motion detection to use state-of-the-art YOLOv8 object detection with DeepSORT tracking. This provides much more robust and accurate object detection and tracking capabilities.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. YOLOv8 Integration
- **Model**: Integrated YOLOv8 pre-trained models (nano, small, medium, large, xlarge)
- **Detection**: Replaced background subtraction with YOLOv8 object detection
- **Classes**: Configurable object classes to track (default: person)
- **Performance**: Automatic model download and GPU acceleration support

### 2. DeepSORT Integration
- **Tracking**: Implemented DeepSORT for robust multi-object tracking
- **IDs**: Maintains consistent track IDs across frames
- **Re-identification**: Handles object occlusion and re-appearance
- **Multi-camera**: Separate DeepSORT trackers for each camera

### 3. Enhanced Configuration
- **YOLOv8 Settings**: Model selection, confidence thresholds, IoU thresholds
- **DeepSORT Settings**: Tracking parameters, embedder configuration
- **Flexible**: Easy to adjust for different use cases

### 4. Improved Object Representation
- **Class Information**: Added YOLO class ID and class name
- **Confidence Scores**: Real detection confidence from YOLOv8
- **3D Positions**: Maintained stereo vision triangulation
- **Track History**: Enhanced tracking history management

## Key Features

### Detection Capabilities
- **Accurate**: YOLOv8 provides state-of-the-art object detection
- **Fast**: Nano model runs at ~8-10 FPS on CPU
- **Flexible**: Can detect multiple object classes
- **Robust**: Handles various lighting and occlusion conditions

### Tracking Capabilities
- **Persistent IDs**: Objects maintain consistent track IDs
- **Occlusion Handling**: DeepSORT handles temporary disappearances
- **Re-identification**: Can re-identify objects after occlusion
- **Multi-camera**: Tracks objects across multiple camera views

### Performance
- **Real-time**: Suitable for real-time applications
- **Configurable**: Can balance speed vs accuracy
- **Scalable**: Works with different YOLOv8 model sizes
- **GPU Support**: Can utilize GPU acceleration when available

### Basic Usage
```python
from object_tracker import ObjectTracker

# Initialize tracker
tracker = ObjectTracker()

# Track objects in frames
tracked_objects = tracker.track_objects(frame1, frame2)

# Draw detections
frame_with_detections = tracker.draw_detections(frame, tracked_objects["camera1"])
```

# Run unit test
python test_yolo_deepsort.py

# Run live demo
python demo_yolo_deepsort.py

# Run demo with video file
python demo_yolo_deepsort.py video.mp4
```

## Configuration Options

### YOLOv8 Configuration
```python
YOLO_MODEL = 'yolov8n.pt'  # Model size
YOLO_CONF_THRESHOLD = 0.5   # Detection confidence
YOLO_IOU_THRESHOLD = 0.45   # IoU threshold
TRACK_CLASSES = ['person']   # Classes to track
```

### DeepSORT Configuration
```python
DEEPSORT_MAX_AGE = 30       # Max frames to keep track
DEEPSORT_N_INIT = 3         # Frames to confirm track
DEEPSORT_MAX_COSINE_DISTANCE = 0.2  # Re-identification threshold
```
